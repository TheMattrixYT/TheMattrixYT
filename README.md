- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TheMattrixYT! You can call me Matt. I am a teenager who does animation and programming as a hobby. I also make art and edit for a musician friend of mine, Half-Decent at Best. Once in a while, I'll upload a repository for a school project or something I made as a hobby.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in mathematics, science, and especially computer science. These days in quarantine, I spend most of my time in front of a screen, playing games or programming.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning high school stuff. I'm still in high school studying hard on my STEM subjects.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Of course, as a teenager, I wouldn't want to do any random programs. I mostly code in Python, and I'm learning C# and C++ for games. However, if you want some help, or if you want to just talk, you can chat me at TheMattrixYT#0104.
