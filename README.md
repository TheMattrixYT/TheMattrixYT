- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TheMattrixYT! You can call me Matt. I am a teenager who does animation and programming as a hobby. I also make art and make music as Half-Decent at Best. Once in a while, I'll upload a repository for a school project or something I made as a hobby.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in mathematics, science, music production, and especially computer science. Currently, I go to face-to-face classes at my high school so I might not always be available.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning high school stuff. I'm still in high school studying hard on my STEM subjects.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Of course, as a teenager, I wouldn't want to do any random programs. I mostly code in Python, and I'm learning C# and C++ for games. However, if you want some help, or if you want to just talk, you can chat me at TheMattrix#0104.
